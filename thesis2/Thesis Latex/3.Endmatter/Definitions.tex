\textbf{Note:} This section contained a summary of all of the most important and frequently used definitions and acronyms used in this thesis. These should have been clearly defined when they are first introduced in this thesis, however it is expected that people may have missed the definitions or was skipping while reading, so will provide a quick explanation when they needed a glossary.
