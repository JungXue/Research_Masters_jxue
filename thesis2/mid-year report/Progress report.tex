\section*{Completed objectives}
\begin{description}
	\item[Literature reviews] 60+literature and notes in sevearl separate word documents. 
	\item[Research proposal] submitted
	\item[Simulation] completed data generation, but still working on JAGS
	\item[ED Data] obtained MIMIC, requesting NMDS and may need to look for gene-expression data. 
	\item[Latex report] 48 pages of drafts and notes here and there, background section 70\% done, other section 10\% ish. 
\end{description}

\section*{Problems}
\begin{description}
	\item[] No real progress during X-mas holidays
	\item[] Spent too much time on simulations
	\item[] Doesn't seem to have enough material for a good Thesis. 
	\item[] Behind in progress
\end{description}

\section*{Further work planned}
\begin{description}
	\item[] Need to speed up progress
	\item[] Need to close off simulation in 2 weeks max 
	\item[] Need to finish results in 8 weeks max (MIMIC, NMDS, Gene expression)
	\item[] Start cleaning up notes and work on latex.
